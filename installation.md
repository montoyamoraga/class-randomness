# Installation

For this class we will be using the following applications, software and tools:

In Mac and Linux it is called "Terminal" and in Windows it is called "Command prompt".
App installed is called "Processing".
 App installed is called "Pd-0.49-1".

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), programming language for general programming. To check if you have Python installed, open your "Command Line interface" and execute the command.
```bash
python
```


TODO: add more instructions

If you are on a Mac, Python2 is already installed in your computer. I recommend to install the package manager [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and then install Python3 with it via the command

```bash
brew install python3
```
